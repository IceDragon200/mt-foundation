# Foundation

Foundation is a extended standard library for minetest mods, by itself no changes are made to the minetest game, this modpack is intended to be used as a library for other mods.

It's aim isn't to be an end-all to the functionality, but rather a quick implementation of some commonly used functions or helpers.

Code can be freely copied from foundation and placed into one's own mod or usecase.

## Components

Foundation's components has been sourced from my own modpacks (yatm and nokore), and serves as the base for those mods.
