# Foundation

Foundation is a extended standard library for minetest mods, by itself no changes are made to the minetest game, this modpack is intended to be used as a library for other mods.

Its aim isn't to be an end-all to the functionality, but rather a quick implementation of some commonly used functions or helpers.

Code can be freely copied from foundation and placed into one's own mod or usecase.

Just remember to strip the namespace off (i.e. `foundation.com`)

## Components

Foundation's components has been sourced from my own modpacks (yatm and nokore), and serves as the base for those mods.
