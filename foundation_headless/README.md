# Foundation Headless

Re-implementation of many of luanti's built-in structures for use in a headless environment, or testing.

Since `3.0.0`, headless also provides the `tetra` namespace which allows mods to use vector4 pos functions for defining "shadow" dimensions, by default this mod only provides the base classes that could be used in place of luanti's built-in.

## Available

* `foundation.com.headless.MetaDataRef`
* `foundation.com.headless.ItemStack`
